# IBM Champion Activity Report - form field reference

Authoritative, **browser-verified** field spec for the **IBM Champion Program -
Activity Report** form (verified 2026-06-29, field by field, against the live form).

- **Form URL:** https://airtable.com/appuwf3eOGdO6x1oS/pagF5IfVT7m6unCbG/form
- **Short URL:** https://www.ibm.biz/champ-report

The form is an Airtable form; it cannot be submitted programmatically and the human
always does the final consent + click. The skill's job is to assemble every value,
polish the free text, and build a **proven** prefilled-form URL plus a copy-paste
sheet for the fields that cannot be prefilled.

> The option lists in Appendix A and Appendix B are scraped **verbatim** from the live
> dropdowns - they are authoritative, not guesses. The raw calibration record
> (field IDs, prefill landings, regression result) lives in the gitignored
> `../form-calibration.yaml`.

## How prefill works on this form (verified)

Airtable prefills via query params: `?prefill_<KEY>=<URLEncodedValue>`, joined with `&`.

- `<KEY>` is normally the underlying **column name**, URL-encoded (space -> `%20`).
  Where this form uses a **custom display label**, the column name differs and the
  label-based param silently fails - you must use the **field ID** instead
  (`prefill_fldXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`).
- Select values must match an option **exactly** (see Appendix A/B).
- Multi-select: comma-separate values inside one param.
- Email values: `@` -> `%40`. Date values: `D/M/YYYY` (leading zeros optional).
- Some fields cannot be prefilled at all (no column-name match and no field ID is
  exposed on the public form). Those are **manual** - they go in the copy-paste sheet.

### Verified field-ID map (the form embeds exactly 9 IDs)

| Field ID | Field |
|---|---|
| `fldt6UIOXVxQBNSgl` | Champion Program ID |
| `fldjaFlaWxJJMsay9` | First name |
| `fldUOjGHPz2HUTMt7` | Last name |
| `fldr9AaDFiKuuZ7Bi` | Primary Email |
| `fldIlTk3tvYKw57x8` | 1st Act of Advocacy (single-select) |
| `fldTWgIi3n3KNErJJ` | Product(s) Involved, 1st activity (multi-select) |
| `fld0aJmUIrBMO2BWh` | 1st-activity Date (required) |
| `fldsYCztbwXKtlxiT` | 2nd-activity Date |
| `fldcB8jM6FBLQD14g` | non-prefillable (likely "How many MORE Acts"; rejects every value type) |

---

## Identity fields (from `.env` - never ask the user for these)

Load from the skill's `.env`; do not prompt for them.

| Form label | `.env` key | Type | Required | VERIFIED prefill param |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Champion Program ID | `CHAMPION_PROGRAM_ID` | numeric | yes | `prefill_fldt6UIOXVxQBNSgl` (field ID; label does NOT work) |
| First name | `FIRST_NAME` | text | yes | `prefill_First%20name` |
| Last name | `LAST_NAME` | text | yes | `prefill_Last%20name` |
| Primary Email | `PRIMARY_EMAIL` | email | yes | `prefill_Primary%20Email` |
| Alternate Email | `ALTERNATE_EMAIL` | email | no | `prefill_Alternate%20Email` |

If `.env` is missing, fall back to the `.env.sample` shape and ask the user to copy it
to `.env` and fill real values once (it is gitignored and stays private).

---

## Per-activity fields

Each submission carries **1 to 3 acts of advocacy**: a 1st act, plus "how many more"
(Zero to 2). Only the **1st act** is reliably prefillable via URL; collect the fields
below for each act.

### 1. Act of Advocacy (single-select, required)

"What type of activity have you contributed?"

- **Prefill:** `prefill_1st%20Act%20of%20Advocacy=<exact option>` (label param works;
  field ID `fldIlTk3tvYKw57x8` also works). The **value must be one of Appendix A
  exactly** - e.g. `Write a Blog or Article` is NOT an option; the real entry is
  `Blog or Article`, and a post on community.ibm.com is best logged as
  `Blog on IBM property`.
- Map the user's activity to the closest Appendix A entry, then confirm: "Closest
  match is *X* - right entry?"

### 2. Product(s) Involved (multi-select, required)

"Select all the product(s) involved. You may select more than one. If your product is
not listed, select **Other** and type the product name."

- **Prefill:** `prefill_fldTWgIi3n3KNErJJ=<opt>` (**field ID only** - the display-label
  param does NOT work). Multiple values: comma-separate in one param, e.g.
  `prefill_fldTWgIi3n3KNErJJ=IBM%20App%20Connect,IBM%20MQ`.
- Values must match Appendix B exactly. There is **no** "App Connect Enterprise" / "ACE"
  entry - the closest is **`IBM App Connect`**.
- Anything not in Appendix B goes via **Other -> type the name**; a free-typed Other
  value cannot be prefilled, so do it manually after the form opens.

### 3. Description of this Activity (free text, required, <= 250 words)

- **NOT prefillable** -> copy-paste / manual. This is where the skill adds the most
  value. Write it for a reviewer who has not seen the work:
  - Lead with what was contributed and who it helps.
  - Name the product(s) and the concrete artifact (post, talk, repo, video).
  - Factual, no fluff, no AI-tool signatures.
  - Hard limit 250 words; report the word count.

### 4. Link to material (URL, strongly recommended)

- **NOT prefillable** -> manual. "Lack of link may result in the disqualification of
  your activity." Always push for one (blog URL, repo, recording, slides, community post).

### 5. Can IBM Amplify this activity? (checkbox)

- **NOT prefillable** -> manual. Ask the user; do not assume.

### 6. Approximate date of activity (date, required)

- **Prefill:** `prefill_fld0aJmUIrBMO2BWh=<D/M/YYYY>` (field ID).
- Format `D/M/YYYY` slash-separated; **leading zeros optional** (`22/5/2026` and
  `22/05/2026` both land; display normalizes to `22/5/2026`).
- "Only report activities contributed in the last year." First-of-month if unknown.

### 7. How many MORE Acts of Advocacy to add (single-select, required)

- Options: **Zero**, **1**, **2**. **NOT prefillable** (defaults to `1`); set manually.
- The 2nd/3rd-act fields are manual too, except the **2nd-activity Date**
  (`prefill_fldsYCztbwXKtlxiT=<D/M/YYYY>`). If the user has more than 3 activities,
  tell them to submit the form again for the overflow.

### 8. PRIVACY consent (checkbox, required)

- The Credly / IBM data-use + privacy consent. **Manual must-tick** - the skill can
  never consent for the user. Flag it as the last manual step before submitting.

---

## Prefilled-form URL (PROVEN)

Regression-verified in-browser: all 8 prefillable fields land together. Build this from
`.env` identity + the assembled 1st-act values. URL-encode values (`@`->`%40`,
space->`%20`).

```
https://airtable.com/appuwf3eOGdO6x1oS/pagF5IfVT7m6unCbG/form?prefill_fldt6UIOXVxQBNSgl=<CHAMPION_PROGRAM_ID>&prefill_First%20name=<FIRST_NAME>&prefill_Last%20name=<LAST_NAME>&prefill_Primary%20Email=<PRIMARY_EMAIL>&prefill_Alternate%20Email=<ALTERNATE_EMAIL>&prefill_1st%20Act%20of%20Advocacy=<ACT_OPTION>&prefill_fldTWgIi3n3KNErJJ=<PRODUCTS_COMMA_SEP>&prefill_fld0aJmUIrBMO2BWh=<D/M/YYYY>
```

**Prefills (8):** Champion Program ID, First name, Last name, Primary Email, Alternate
Email, 1st Act of Advocacy, Product(s), 1st-activity Date.

**Always manual after the URL opens (cannot be prefilled):** Description, Link, Can IBM
Amplify, How-many-more, PRIVACY consent, and all 2nd/3rd-act fields except their date.
Put these in the copy-paste sheet.

---

## Browser automation (fill the form in place)

If a browser-automation MCP is available, you can drive the form directly. The proven
prefilled URL already lands the 8 fields above; use automation to add the manual fields
(Description, Link, Amplify) and to verify.

### Tool-agnostic action vocabulary

Skills do not hardcode tool names - read the live tool list and use whatever browser MCP
is installed. Map these abstract actions onto the concrete tools you find:

| Action | Browser/Playwright MCP | Chrome DevTools MCP | Claude-in-Chrome MCP |
|---|---|---|---|
| Open a URL | `browser_navigate` | `navigate_page` | `navigate` |
| Read the page (a11y snapshot) | `browser_snapshot` | `take_snapshot` | `read_page` / `get_page_text` |
| Click an element | `browser_click` | `click` | `computer` (left_click) |
| Type into a field | `browser_type` | `fill` | `computer` (type) / `form_input` |
| Choose a select option | `browser_select_option` | click the option | click the option |
| Read field values / DOM | - | `evaluate_script` | `javascript_tool` |

If **no** browser MCP is present, skip this section, say so, and deliver the prefilled
URL + copy-paste sheet only.

### Why the real Chrome matters

Prefer a browser MCP that drives the user's **actual logged-in Chrome** (extension-based,
e.g. Claude-in-Chrome or browsermcp.io). The form sits behind `ibm.biz/champ-report`; a
fresh logged-out profile may hit a login wall. If it does, stop and ask the user to log
in (or switch to an extension-based MCP), then resume.

### Fill procedure (fill + verify, never submit)

1. **Navigate** to the proven prefilled URL above (identity + Act + Product + Date land
   automatically).
2. **Snapshot** and confirm those 8 fields populated. Match fields by visible **label
   text**, not brittle selectors - Airtable markup is generated.
3. **Type the manual fields:** Description (polished, <=250 words), Link (URL).
4. **Amplify checkbox:** tick **only** if the user explicitly allowed amplification.
5. **Re-snapshot and verify:** report each field as set / not set / mismatch; retry
   failures once.
6. **Stop before submit.** Do **NOT** tick the **PRIVACY** consent checkbox and do
   **NOT** click **Submit**. Leave the filled form open and hand control back.

### Hard rules for automation

- Never tick the PRIVACY / Credly consent checkbox on the user's behalf.
- Never click Submit. The human reviews, consents, and submits.
- Never type the user's identity values into anything other than the live form fields
  (no logs, no committed files).
- If the page is unrecognizable (redesign, login wall, captcha), stop and fall back to
  the copy-paste sheet.
